## Rough TODO List (Please Help)

- **Make Timetable Page smoother/prettier**
- Scrub last vestige of CATE from homepage - the favicon! Use [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/260857/changing-website-favicon-dynamically/260876#260876)
- Non-Undergrads may experience missing/broken links. I have no idea.

## Ideas

- Timetable page
  - Work on condensed version for dashboard
  - Notify of upcoming deadlines
  - Aggregate links to notes, exercises without jumping around a huge
  table, possibly include a download all function?

## Development

To develop and help improve classy-cate, do the following:

1. Run the server with `thin start -p 4567 --ssl`
2. Modify `classy-cate.user.js` to point to your local server assets
3. Modify `views/classy_cate.coffee.erb` and `views/classy_cate.less` to add/modify functionality as you wish!

## Want to help, but don't have a clue?

Hopefully some first years will want to contribute to this project. If
you're one of them, but are put off by what seems like a stupid amount
of complexity just to get it working, then have a look at [this](https://github.com/LawrenceJones/classy-cate/wiki/Getting-off-the-Ground-for-Development) page to get you started.
